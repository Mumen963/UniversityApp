# University Enrolment System

*The application will represent a university enrolment system. It permits the addition, removal, and retrieval of student data within various academic faculties. Universities can utilize this project to maintain comprehensive student databases. This project holds an interest for me because I've always been curious about how universities manage student information. I will be creating a similar project and continually enhancing it for future use.*
